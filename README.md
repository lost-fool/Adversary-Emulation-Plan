# Adversary-Emulation-Plan

- Introduction
-   Team Members: Adeel Fareed, Brian Fields, Harshal Shinde, Solomon Ruzima, Ugochukwu Egonu.
-   Description of project
-     This project is intended to apply the MITRE ATT&CK framework and tools to map a cyber incident and then use the Caldera tool to complete an emulation plan. The attack chosen is a 2020 spear phishing campaign launched against Twitter, in which the credentials of many high profile users were compromised.
-   Objectives of the attack
-     To identify a real-world cybersecurity incident that we will make to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.
-     To map a real-world incident to the MITRE ATT&CK framework. By mapping the attack to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, we will be able to understand the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by attackers in a specific incident.
-     To use the information gathered in the mapping process to create an Adversary Emulation Plan using the Caldera tool that simulates the identified incident.
-     To conduct an emulation of the incident using the created Adversary Emulation Plan in a mock-up scenario built in the cloud that accurately represents the system compromised in the incident. ​
-     To create an incident report including a STIX2.1JSON representation using the information gathered in the incident mapping and emulation.​
- Tools/Applications
-     Caldera
-       Attack emulation tool created by MITRE to simulate and map attacks using the ATT&CK framework.
-     Wazuh
-       Open-source security platform that unifies XDR and SIEM protection for endpoints and cloud workloads.
-     Squid
-       Squid is a caching and forwarding HTTP web proxy. It has a wide variety of uses, including speeding up a web server by caching repeated requests, caching web, DNS and other computer network lookups.
-     Social Engineering Toolkit
-       Open-source penetration testing framework designed for social engineering using a number of custom attack vectors.
-     Web Domains w/ Email Accounts
